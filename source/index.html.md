# Introduction

Welcome to the Kevy API! You can use our API to access Kevy API endpoints, which can get information on various campaigns, lists, contacts, and automations in our database.

We have language bindings in Shell! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: kevyapikey"
```

> Make sure to replace `kevyapikey` with your API key.

Kevy uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can request a new Kevy API key at by contacting Support[support@kevy.co].

Kevy expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: kevyapikey`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>kevyapikey</code> with your personal API key.

# Lists

## Get All Lists

curl "http://example.com/api/lists"
  -H "Authorization: kevyapikevy"
```

```javascript
const kevy = require('kevy');

let api = kevy.authorize('kevyapikevy');
let lists = api.lists.get();
```

> The above command returns JSON structured like this:

```json

  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Fluffums",
    "breed": "calico",
    "fluffiness": 6,
